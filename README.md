# Deep Learning Lab

A collection of deep learning and computer vision projects developed during my Deep Learning lab course.

## Projects

### 1. [Face & Gesture Recognition System](./projects/face-gesture-recognition/)
Real-time computer vision system combining face recognition with hand gesture detection. Identifies individuals and their gestures simultaneously using LBPH and ONNX neural networks.

**Tech Stack:** Python, OpenCV, ONNX Runtime, NumPy

### 2. [Speaker Identification System](./projects/speaker-identification/)
Deep learning-based speaker identification using CNN. Converts audio into mel-spectrograms and achieves 100% test accuracy on trained speakers with real-time prediction capabilities.

**Tech Stack:** Python, PyTorch, Librosa, Flask

### 3. [Zoom Virtual Background](./projects/zoom-virtual-background/)
Virtual background implementation for video conferencing applications.

**Tech Stack:** Python, OpenCV
