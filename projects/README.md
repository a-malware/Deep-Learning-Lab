# Deep Learning Projects

This directory contains various deep learning and computer vision projects.

## Projects

### 1. Face & Gesture Recognition System
**Directory:** `face-gesture-recognition/`

A real-time computer vision system that combines face recognition with hand gesture detection. The system can identify individuals and their corresponding gestures simultaneously.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time face recognition using LBPH algorithm
- Hand gesture detection (peace, thumbs up, stop)
- Spatial association between faces and gestures
- Multi-person support
- 15-30 FPS performance

**Technologies:** OpenCV, ONNX Runtime, Python

### 2. Speaker Identification System
**Directory:** `speaker-identification/`

A deep learning-based speaker identification system using CNN. Converts audio into mel-spectrograms and uses image classification techniques for speaker recognition.

**Key Features:**
- 100% test accuracy on trained speakers
- Real-time prediction from microphone input
- Web interface with Flask
- Audio enhancement and preprocessing
- Lightweight model (33K parameters)

**Technologies:** Python, PyTorch, Librosa, Flask
